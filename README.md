### What I learned

In this project I reviewed some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS, things that I had already learned before but it never hurts to keep practicing.

### Continued development

At the moment I'm just starting out with web development, so I'd like to become more agile when creating content, so I'll keep practicing in general.
